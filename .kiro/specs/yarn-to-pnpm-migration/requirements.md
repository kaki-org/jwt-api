# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the frontend project located in `./front/` from yarn package manager to pnpm. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while improving package management performance and disk space efficiency. The project is a Nuxt.js 3.x application with Vuetify components, currently managed with yarn and deployed using Docker containers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use pnpm instead of yarn for package management in the frontend project, so that I can benefit from faster installations, better disk space efficiency, and improved dependency resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use pnpm instead of yarn for all package management operations
2. WHEN running `pnpm install` THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies correctly without errors
3. WHEN running development commands THEN the system SHALL use pnpm instead of yarn in all npm scripts
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL produce the same output as the current yarn-based build

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Docker configurations to support pnpm, so that the containerized development and production environments work seamlessly with the new package manager.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the Docker image THEN the system SHALL use pnpm for dependency installation
2. WHEN running the frontend container THEN the system SHALL execute pnpm commands correctly
3. WHEN the Docker container starts THEN the system SHALL have all dependencies properly installed via pnpm
4. WHEN using docker-compose THEN the system SHALL support pnpm-based frontend development

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing npm scripts to work with pnpm, so that development workflows remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN the system SHALL start the development server successfully
2. WHEN running `pnpm build` THEN the system SHALL build the production bundle successfully
3. WHEN running `pnpm lint` THEN the system SHALL execute linting checks successfully
4. WHEN running any existing script THEN the system SHALL produce the same results as with yarn

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to preserve all current dependencies and their versions, so that application functionality remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all current dependency versions
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve to the same package versions as yarn.lock
3. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL function identically to the yarn-based version
4. IF there are version conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them while maintaining compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper cleanup of yarn-related files, so that the project doesn't contain conflicting package manager artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove yarn.lock file
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove yarn from dependencies if present
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL create pnpm-lock.yaml file
4. WHEN checking the project THEN the system SHALL contain no references to yarn in configuration files

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation and configuration files, so that other developers understand the new package manager setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL update all documentation references from yarn to pnpm
2. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN the system SHALL show pnpm commands in all relevant places
3. WHEN checking steering files THEN the system SHALL reflect the new pnpm-based workflow
4. WHEN new developers join THEN the system SHALL provide clear pnpm-based setup instructions
